      <p>[Delete existing text and enter your own in this section] The Digital Age we are in is changing how we live and work in profound ways. Connected computers are all around, generating and sharing data, often unseen. Intelligent digital systems are merging with physical objects, from driverless cars to "smart" homes. Our quality of life, health, and even physical safety are dependent on digital systems we might not even be aware of.</p>
      <p>Whilst bringing immeasurable benefits to humanity, the accelerating proliferation of technology also brings increased risk. As the internet expands into all aspects of life, malicious actors taking advantage of the same innovations find greater opportunity to inflict harm.</p>
      <p>Amongst many technical innovations of the Digital Age we will discuss in this programme, three in particular have a disproportionate impact on cyber security and are of the highest concern to today's business leaders:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The internet of things (IoT)</li>
      <li>Big data</li>
      <li>Artificial intelligence</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>The Internet of Things</h5>
      <p>The IoT is a broad collection of physical devices that are connected to the internet and exchange data with other devices. IoT devices can range from industrial controls to home kitchen gadgets, critical medical devices to thermostats, environmental monitoring sensors to clothing. </p>
      <p>As noted above, there are now over 21 billion IoT devices, and the number is increasing dramatically each year. These devices provide a range of benefits, from increasing efficiency and reducing costs, to allowing greater mobility and communications, to providing business opportunities. </p>
      <p>At the same time, the IoT presents new cyber challenges. Many IoT devices are not built with security or privacy in mind, and their rapid proliferation is increasing the attack surface that we need to defend. For example, the Infosecurity group reports that malicious actors can use internet-connected doorbells to covertly record audio and video indefinitely, invading the privacy of victims on their very own doorsteps (Coble, 2020). </p>
      <p>In addition, existing risk assessment methodologies were established prior to development of the IoT and do not account for its complexity or pervasiveness (Nurse et al, 2017).</p>
      <h5>Big Data</h5>
      <p>Gil Press, a senior contributor at Forbes, estimated in January 2020 that 35 zettabytes (35 trillion gigabytes) of new data would be created by the end of the year. He posits that, driven by 5G networks, satellite internet, and AI, the growth rate of data generation will continue to accelerate.</p>
      <p>The author makes six predictions about data in this decade:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Faster networks will re-energise the "virtuous cycle of data".</li>
      <li>There will be many new places for data to emerge and spread.</li>
      <li>Synthetic data will add a new dimension to data growth.</li>
      <li>The business of data will become a significant sector of the global economy.</li>
      <li>The most successful and well-paying jobs will be data-related.</li>
      <li>We will continue to trade our data privacy for convenience, entertainment, and feelings of connection.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Often this data is being stored in huge data lakes with insufficient governance and security, creating risks and challenges for businesses around the globe.</p>
      <h5>Cloud Computing</h5>
      <p>The rise of cloud computing offers economic benefits, but those benefits come with heightened security and privacy risks, including loss of governance, isolation failure, malicious insiders, and more (Creese et al, 2011).</p>
      <h5>Artificial Intelligence </h5>
      <p>As artificial intelligence (AI) spreads into more parts of our lives, there is growing concern about how these technologies are affecting individuals and communities. AI presents issues of privacy, manipulation, transparency, and bias. (We will examine these issues more closely in Module 4.)  </p>
