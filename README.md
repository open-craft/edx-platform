# OpenCraft fork of edx-platform

This is OpenCraft's fork of https://github.com/edx/edx-platform

We push branches here that are used for pull requests against
the upstream edx-platform repository or other forks.

This fork also holds the opencraft-release branches of edx-platform
which may contain backported fixes for compatibility with
[Ocim](https://github.com/open-craft/opencraft).

The **master** branch of this repository is meaningless - do not
refer to it nor use it as a base branch for changes to edx-platform.
Always use the edx/edx-platform master branch as a
starting point, or whatever other branch is appropriate.
